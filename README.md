Hello Avro
=========

A sample app showing how to use the awesome Apache Avro serializer.

To run this sample application

1. Download the git repository (duh!)
2. Open the solution (.sln) in visual studio 
3. Hit F5

## Key items ##

1. Avro data structure(s) are defined in `Avro\IDL\*.avdl` files
2. Running `code-gen.bat` compiled them into the C# class files
3. The main logic is in `SerializerAvro.cs`

Enjoy!
